I am the ideal candidate based on my tenacious problem solving, aptitude for learning new things, programming experience, extensive software and hardware testing and education. I graduated from the University of Alberta with a Mathematics Major and Physics Minor in 2020 during the start of Covid-19. In preparation for a career in software development I then taught myself python/bash scripting and the linux operating system.\n\n`;

    const exp = `I've had two software development positions. At Window Mart I was responsible for maintaining the legacy codebase, as well as updating the internal staff website and consumer facing site. I learned considerable web development and improved my python fundamentals. The entire tech team worked in the same office and communication was primarily in person. We had no QA so the superior practice of test driven development happened by the juniors running tests on each other's code. Next I joined the SAAS company Zippedscript where my role focused on automating and refining processes to improve efficiency and reduce duplication of effort. Our product was based on the flask framework and I helped considerably with front end design tasks. I deployed gui and headless debian servers to run selenium grid. This position was fully remote, so I learned to communicate effectively using slack/trello/google meets. At this role self testing code before pushing to github was essential. Since then I have been working in tech support for Teleperformance, helping customers troubleshoot their hardware and software issues with their Apple products.\n\n`;
